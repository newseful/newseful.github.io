title: A Reference Manual

In order to establish a more firm footing in the vocabulary, concepts, influences, and ideas at play in this project, I have created an ever-expanding reference tool. [This glossary of sorts](/reference/) will help me keep track of and map the mental space for my project. I'm still working on it, but as of right now the basic pieces are in place. The hope is that this reference tool will help me expose helpful connections, as well as highlight problematic circular logic in my understanding of key concepts in this project. I've also made it easy to update in the hopes that it will continue to grow and evolve as my project does.
