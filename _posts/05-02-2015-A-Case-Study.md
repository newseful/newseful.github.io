title: A Case Study (Three Case Studies)
layout: post
--- 

I spent some time [researching](http://github.com/agendae/research/) a few major news events from the past year. The purpose of the research was twofold: first, I wanted to search for inconsistencies and misreported facts—to try and identify where things went wrong in the reporting and relaying of these stories; second, I wanted to review the timelines of these events in hindsight—to compare and contrast my remembered experience of these sequences with the documentation of them that came out in the end.

The events that I chose to research all occurred in the past year. I figured that limiting myself to this timescale would allow me to better compare my research to my memory, and it would also make it easier to sift through social media for relevant information. I discovered early in my process that the twitter API is not nearly so open as I thought it was for accessing data over 10 days old, which meant that my hopes for tracking the sources of misinformed viral tweets were somewhat less feasible. That said, I found tons of “Timeline of *X*” style posts which were great for bumping hindsight up to 20/20. 

## Sony Pictures Hack

Of the three events I researched, the Sony hack was by far the most straight-forward. With one major exception, very few facts of the story were ever disputed or called into question. The story is notable for it’s long tail—the preamble to the events that would really be considered breaking news began years before the drama of December 2014, as North Korea expressed its dissatisfaction with the film throughout the production process. The real coverage didn’t begin until sources inside Sony revealed the Guardians of Peace hack on November 24. From this point, the story progressed in a fairly linear way, but even within a seemingly simple series of connected events, there are multiple overlapping narratives, and understanding the way that these narratives interact is a key part of understanding why events unfolded as they did.

It makes sense to break the narratives down by the different groups involved. The obvious starting point here is Sony. Sony started producing the Interview way back in 2013, and the movie provides the base scenario that the events of Winter 2014 grew out of. So the driving timeline of the story was the production schedule of the interview, which stretched from initial casting in October of 2013 to the interrupted release schedule in December of 2014.

The second group to enter the timeline is the North Korean state. They enter the story in June of 2014, expressing discontent with the film shortly after the release of the theatrical trailer, and quickly ramping up rhetoric to declare the release of the film an “act of war”.

The third group in the timeline is the Guardians of Peace. The existence of GOP as a sovereign group rather than an arm of the North Korean government is questionable in hindsight, but in the context of a developing narrative maintaining the distinction is important.

These three groups make up the core actors of the events, but there are more levels that must be accounted for. The FBI, being directly involved in the investigation of GOP stands as a sort of pseudo-actor, in that they undeniably effected the events of the story. In objectivity, we should include the government of North Korea in the same category—neither are (verifiably) primary actors in the story, but both did contribute significantly to the arc of the narrative.

On a less central timeline we have the media reaction and cultural commentary that occurred during the development of this story. This would encompass the media storm that ensued as the leaked documents were parsed and exposed controversies about internal issues at Sony, and it would extend from particularly notable tweets all the way to Obama’s address calling Sony’s decision to pull the film a mistake.

The purpose of parsing the events for these different timelines must not be to establish a hierarchy of influence, but to make the chain of cause and event more legible. In a 1-dimensional timeline, actors and events must all be stored in the same physical space. A 2-dimensional timeline allows actors to be separated, and their interactions can be more clearly laid out and understood.

## Charlie Hebdo Attack

In early January of 2015, masked gunmen stormed the Paris office of French satire publication Charlie Hebdo, killing 12. Over the course of the next two days, a massive manhunt unfolded in France, and a secondary attack of questionable affiliation with the first took the lives of four more citizens. Early speculation on the religious underpinnings of the attacks activated a dark streak of Islamophobia in Paris and beyond and dominated coverage by the media.

In the midst and wake of this tragically violent week, social media erupted with an outpouring of support for the victims of the attacks, and the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie exploded, quickly becoming the most-used hashtag in the history of Twitter. The public outcry in defense of freedom of the press found physical form in the streets of Paris as citizens gathered by the thousands in support of the victims.

However, after the dramatic events of the week came to an end, a public discussion arose about the content of Charlie Hebdo--certainly none would suggest that the journalists deserved what happened to them, but given the paper's frequently racist and xenophobic character a heated debate about the limits and responsibilities of a free press. While violence against Hebdo was absolutely an unacceptable and horrific response to its content in the eyes of any rational onlooker, the public discussion surrounding the attacks brought into question the typical "Can't you take a joke?" mentality of brash satire.

As such, the timeline of the Charlie Hebdo attacks is more heavily weighted than that of the Sony Pictures debacle. The events of the Sony timeline were more spread out, allowing public discussion to develop in parallel. The events of the Hebdo timeline were much more concentrated, with public discussion and commentary evolving largely after the attacks themselves had concluded.
