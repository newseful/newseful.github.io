title: A Few Options

At some point, I will have to decide what form this project will take. Here are a few options that have been in the back of my mind.

1. **Stand-alone News Aggregator/Dashboard**--In this case, Agendae would exist as an independent website and mobile application which uses a combination of all/some of the following: smart filtering/aggregation from multiple sources, crowdsourced fact-checking *(see Wikipedia)*, and editorial staffing/human curation in order to best adapt to the changing narrative of a developing story. Creating a web and mobile application allows for tracking a story at rest or in motion. Working as a standalone application gives much more latitude to present metadata such as disputed facts, source reliability, timelines, &amp;c.

2. **Browser Extension As Improved Discussion Platform**--Here, Agendae would function more as an augmentation to the traditional browser experience in the breaking news context. Launching the extension could provide clarity and identify the best links on social media sites, and facilitate deeper discussion, public annotation, and cross-referencing in ways that standard comment sections on existing news outlets do not.

3. **Embedded Developing Story Widget**--This would try to accomplish many of the same things as option one, but would take the form of an embeddable widget as a proposed alternative to existing live-feed and breaking news formats on news sites. The hope would be to create something that allows the news publishers to act as curators in aggregating links, tweets, and their own updates, and improves upon existing patterns for breaking stories in these contexts as discussed in *A New Format For Developing News* below.
