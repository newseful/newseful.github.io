title: A New Format For Developing News
layout: post
---

We now experience news in real-time. Twitter, Facebook, streaming platforms, and established news sources provide up-to-the minute updates on current events, but none of them were designed explicitly for developing news coverage. The format of our stories hasn't yet caught up with the speed of their distribution. This leads to a proliferation of unverified facts in the race to publish first, and the noise of the crowd can often overwhelm responsible reportage. 

In cases such as the August 2014 police shooting in Ferguson, MO, the spread of exaggerated and inaccurate facts draws discussion and debate away from the central issues of the story and casts doubt upon the credibility of those involved in relaying information. Ultimately, in the case of Ferguson, the spread of misreported events led to a steep decline in public interest and sympathy as the sensational "perfect victim" stories that spread so quickly on social media were eventually corrected to something more complex, resulting in a greatly diminished stage for public debate and a missed opportunity for the development of a real movement. Inaccuracy in these situations diverts meaningful debate into shouting matches over who did what and when they did it.

The end form of Agendae is as yet undetermined, but the mandate of the project is to explore new ways in which developing news stories can be handled given the demand for immediacy in the current news media context.
