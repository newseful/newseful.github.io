title: A New Format For Developing News
layout: default
---

We now experience news in real-time. Twitter, Facebook, streaming platforms, and established news sources provide up-to-the minute updates on current events, but none of them were designed explicitly for developing news coverage. The format of our stories hasn't yet caught up with the speed of their distribution. This leads to a proliferation of unverified facts in the race to publish first, and the noise of the crowd can often overwhelm responsible reportage. 

In the August 2014 police shooting in Ferguson, MO, the spread of exaggerated and inaccurate facts drew discussion and debate away from the central issues of the story and cast doubt upon the credibility of those involved in relaying information. Ultimately, in the case of Ferguson, the spread of misreported events led to a steep decline in public interest and sympathy as the sensational "perfect victim" stories that spread so quickly on social media were eventually corrected to something more complex, resulting in a greatly diminished stage for public debate and a missed opportunity for the development of a real movement. Inaccuracy in these situations diverts meaningful debate into shouting matches over who did what and when they did it.

The end form of Agendae is as yet undetermined, but the mandate of the project is to explore new ways in which developing news stories can be handled given the demand for immediacy in the current news media context.

## Current Outlets

Breaking news comes to us through a variety of outlets. A decent proposed change to the way we consume these stories would take into consideration the existing outlets by which content of this type is distributed:

* **Twitter**--Emotional and measured responses from global network. Mixed relevance and reliability.
* **Facebook**--Emotional responses from sheltered network. Limited relevance.
* **Trusted Sources**--Professional journalism from established and reliable news sources. *e.g. New York Times, The Atlantic, Boston Globe, etc.*
* **Clickbait**--Low quality journalism from content mills seeking to convert global buzz into advertising revenue. *e.g. Buzzfeed, Upworthy, Daily Mail, etc.*
* **Television**--Traditionally thought of as reliable, however, 24-hour news cycles contribute to demand for constant updates and can result in misreported facts in a developing story. *e.g. CNN, NBC, FOX, etc.*

Agendae will be most useful not as an alternative outlet, but as a tool to clarify existing outlets in the specific context of a developing news story. The publication of content would still happen on existing platforms, Agendae would optimize consumption.

## Current Formats

It is useful to separate the outlet from the format. The outlet-format relationship is not necessarily one-to-one, nor is each outlet representative of a unique format.

* **Feed**--Common on social media sites. Feeds allow for fast absorption of many perspectives, and often implement tagging systems for quick filtering.
* **Article**--Classic journalistic format. In the case of developing stories, articles are often clumsily extended with multiple updates, or supplanted entirely by other articles.
* **Briefing**--Abbreviated version of an article characterized by point-by-point summary of events. Ordered format makes it more receptive to updates, but the format is still ill-suited to events-in-progress.
* **Video**--Non-live video showing or summarizing events and/or commentary.
* **Stream**--Live, on-location footage of events unfolding in real time, or major figures offering commentary or updates in such a manner that their commentary or updates become part of the story.

The distinction between video and stream can be somewhat tricky. The key difference is whether the commentary or comes from a source other than classic news media. President Obama making a surprise address is a stream, Wolf Blitzer discussing his thoughts is not. The Attorney General of Missouri reporting the Grand Jury's decision in the case of Darren Wilson is a stream, NBC Nightly's report of the decision is not.
