Agendae is an exploratory project seeking new models for the display and dissemination of developing news stories on the internet. The explicit goal of the project is finding patterns that:

1. Reduce the spread of misreported facts and speculation,
2. Make it easier to keep track of a developing story across multiple device contexts, and
3. Leverage the inherent qualities of digital media to enhance understanding
